# Deploy LoveBridge to Vercel

## Quick Steps:

1. **Go to https://vercel.com**
2. **Sign up** (free account)
3. **Create New Project**
4. **Upload your build folder**

Your build folder is ready at:
`C:\Users\godsh\Downloads\lab2-skeleton\build`

## Alternative: Use Your Phone as Hotspot

If you want to test immediately:
1. **Turn on your iPhone hotspot**
2. **Connect your PC to your iPhone's WiFi**
3. **Both use the same network**
4. **Access http://192.168.1.12:3000**

## Current Status:
✅ App is working locally at http://localhost:3000
✅ Build is ready for deployment
✅ No runtime errors (compilation successful)

The app is fully functional - you just need to make it accessible across different networks!
